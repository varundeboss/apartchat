# ApartChat

Apartchat is a NLP based search engine for searching apartment seeking and sharing posts by users

## Prerequisite

```text
Couchbase - https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/install/ubuntu-debian-install.html
Install and create a bucket `vc-search` with credential `vc-search`
```

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements.

```bash
pip3 install git+git://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-python-client
pip3 install spacy
```

## Dependencies

```text
generate_data.py is used for generating user, apartment and post related data based on user input count

generate_load_data.sh executes generate_data.py to generate the following data and load them 
	into couchbase(NoSQL DB)
	1) posts
	2) users
	3) apartments

search_apartment.py is the NLP based search engine which uses `spacy` to do natural language processing 
	and connects to the backend DB for quering out data based on posts, users and apartments
```

## Usage

```bash
cd /home/varun/workspace/personal/apartchat
python3 search_apartment.py
```
1) Execute the Apartment Search Program

```

## Enum values

The following are the enum values which are used for NLP and is expandable in the future based on market research
```python
USER_TYPES = [
	"SHARER", # One who is already a renter looking to share an apartment
	"SEEKER" # One who is looking for an apartment to rent
]

GENDERS = {
	"M": ["Male", "Guy", "Man", "He"],
	"F": ["Female", "Girl", "Woman", "She"],
}

FOOD_TYPES = {
	'Vegetarian': ["veg", "Vegetarian"],
	'Non Vegetarian': ["non veg", "non Vegetarian"],
}

USER_TAGS = [ "Dog Friendly", "Cat Friendly", "Party", "Dog Lover", "Cat Lover", "Loves Cat", "Loves Dog", "Easy Going",
	"Non Smoker", "Non Smoking", "Non Drinker", "Non Drinking", "Doesnt Drink", "Doesn't Drink", "Doesnt Smoke", 
	"Doesn't Smoke", "Dont Smoke", "Don't Smoke", "Don't Drink", "Dont Drink", "Not Drink", "Not Smoke", "Loves Pet",
	"Pet Lover",
]

APARTMENT_FURNISH_TYPE = [ "FULLY-FURNISHED", "SEMI-FURNISHED", "UN-FURNISHED", ]

APARTMENT_TAGS = [ "Air Conditioned", "Elevator", "Swimming Pool", "Parking", "Dog Friendly", "Cat Friendly", "Park", 
	"Bus stop", "Lake view", "Sea Side", "Pet Friendly", "Pets Allowed", "Metro", "Beach Side",
]
```

## Roadmap

In future the search engine could be enhanced to include 
1) More machine learned models
2) Promote posts
3) Apply decay factor to the freshness of the posts while bringing them up in the result
4) More complex entities such as current user location to be resolved
5) Context based searching for user / apartment tags

## Disclaimer

The NLP based search engine is only a prototype for POC that searches for online based posts (user / apartments) could be 
done using machine learning models and NLP when trained on proper corpus of data sets
